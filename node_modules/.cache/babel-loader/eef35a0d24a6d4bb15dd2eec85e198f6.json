My daily duties made it so that I was operating on average \",\r\n\t\t\t\"with a little over 4 hours of sleep every day for weeks, every other day at four am sharp we \",\r\n\t\t\t\"would run miles, never truly knowing how long or how far we would run to. One day we run for \",\r\n\t\t\t\"what felt like an eternity, during this run I came to a point where I literally wanted to give up \",\r\n\t\t\t\"and I began questioning why I joined the army in the first place. My life at that instant was \",\r\n\t\t\t\"literally void of all meaning; I had lost all possible aspirations in ever completing my training.\",\r\n\t\t\t\"Within that minute, time within my perception had halted. In that minute I began to think, attempting \",\r\n\t\t\t\"to find hope; reason; meaning anything that would trigger me to continue to push onwards. \",\r\n\t\t\t\"For a slight second, I snapped out of my perpetual sense of hopelessness and I noticed the person \",\r\n\t\t\t\"in front of me, Montez, he was one of my best friends while I was at training. I saw the look \",\r\n\t\t\t\"anguish and resentment on his face as he struggled to keep pace. That picture that is now \",\r\n\t\t\t\"engraved in my memory was all I needed to keep pushing myself, in an instant all meaning and \",\r\n\t\t\t\"hope had returned to me. I no longer thought of myself as an individual but as a member of a \",\r\n\t\t\t\"unit. Witnessing Montez struggle allowed me to feel as if I was not struggling alone, \",\r\n\t\t\t\"but that I was struggling collectively with others who were right here living in the moment next to \",\r\n\t\t\t\"me, men and women who were just as tired and miserable as I was. This experience has shown me the \",\r\n\t\t\t\"reality to Frankl’s claim from Man’s Search for Meaning that “everything can be taken from a \",\r\n\t\t\t\"man but one thing; the last of the human freedoms-to choose one’s attitude in any given set of \",\r\n\t\t\t\"circumstances, to choose one’s own way” (Frankl). Through my struggle, it was not until I had \",\r\n\t\t\t\"reached my breaking point was I able to find meaning and purpose for my own struggling. \"\r\n\t\t].join( \"\" ),\r\n\t\textra: \"Nothing extra yet, more personal writings to come\"\r\n\t}\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const GET_ON_CLICK_FOR_NAV_BAR = {\r\n\tNAV_BAR_ON_CLICK: {\r\n\t\thandleItemClick: ( e, {name} ) => this.setState( {activeItem: name} )\r\n\t}\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const GET_NAV_BAR_ITEM = {\r\n\tNAV_BAR_LOGO: {\r\n\t\tas: Link,\r\n\t\ticon: <Image size=\"tiny\" src={images.NAV_BAR_LOGO} avatar />,\r\n\t\tto: \"/\",\r\n\t\tname:null,\r\n\t\tposition: \"left\",\r\n\t\tactive: false\r\n\t},\r\n\tNAV_BAR_HOME: {\r\n\t\tas: Link,\r\n\t\tname: \"home\",\r\n\t\tto: routes.LANDING,\r\n\t\t//active: () => this.state.activeItem === this.NAV_BAR_DEN_STORIES.name,\r\n\t\t//onClick: () => this.handleItemClick()\r\n\t},\r\n\tNAV_BAR_DEN_STORIES: {\r\n\t\tas: Link,\r\n\t\tname: \"stories from the den\",\r\n\t\tto: routes.DEN_STORIES,\r\n\t\tactive: () => {return this.state.activeItem === this.NAV_BAR_DEN_STORIES.name},\r\n\t\tonClick: () => {return this.GET_ON_CLICK_FOR_NAV_BAR.handleItemClick();}\r\n\t},\r\n\tNAV_BAR_GALLERY: {\r\n\t\tas: Link,\r\n\t\tname: \"gallery\",\r\n\t\tto: routes.GALLERY,\r\n\t\t//active: ()=> [this.state.activeItem] === this.name,\r\n\t\t//onClick: () => this.handleItemClick()\r\n\t},\r\n\t\r\n\tNAV_BAR_GIT_HUB: {\r\n\t\tas: \"a\",\r\n\t\tto: externalRoutes.GIT_HUB,\r\n\t\thref: externalRoutes.GIT_HUB,\r\n\t\ticon: <Icon name=\"github\" size=\"big\" color=\"teal\" />,\r\n\t\tposition: \"right\",\r\n\t\tactive: false\r\n\t},\r\n\tNAV_BAR_LINKEDIN: {\r\n\t\tas: \"a\",\r\n\t\tto: externalRoutes.GIT_HUB,\r\n\t\thref: externalRoutes.LINKEDIN, \r\n\t\ticon: <Icon name=\"linkedin\" size=\"big\" color=\"violet\" />,\r\n\t\tactive: false\r\n\t}\r\n};\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
